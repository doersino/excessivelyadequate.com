In case you're not aware: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is a command-line tool that provides powerful and robust video manipulation, conversion, and streaming functionality. Since that's a complex domain – there's myriads of video and audio formats which may or may not intermingle within various kinds of containers, and countless operations that one might wish to perform on any of all of these – FFmpeg's command-line interface is equally[^sense] complex.

[^sense]: It increasingly makes sense as you spend more time with it, though! Notably, [video filters](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html) feel like a rabbit hole made of of graph-flavored, powerful, complicated magic.

As a result, many casual FFmpeg users maintain a list of frequently-used or tricky-to-replicate invocations of the tool in a text file of some kind.

You can find [mine on GitHub](https://github.com/doersino/ffmpeg-koraktor) – over there, not here in this blog post, because I find myself updating it with new bits and bobs somewhat frequently. Among other operations, my *koraktor*[^koraktor] covers [stabilizing a video](https://github.com/doersino/ffmpeg-koraktor#stabilizing-a-video) using FFmpeg's `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform` tooling, [vertically and horizontally stacking videos](https://github.com/doersino/ffmpeg-koraktor#vertically-and-horizontally-stacking-videos), [extracting all frames of a video into separate image files](https://github.com/doersino/ffmpeg-koraktor#extracting-frames-from-a-60-fps-video) for later analysis, [removing blemishes from videos](https://github.com/doersino/ffmpeg-koraktor#cutting-out-a-corner), and [transcoding M4A audio to MP3](https://github.com/doersino/ffmpeg-koraktor#transcoding-m4a-to-mp3).

[^koraktor]: Based on the name of a grimoire – a book of magic – that appears in [Otfried Preußler's novel "Krabat"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krabat_(novel)).

Perhaps one of these will come in handy for you!
