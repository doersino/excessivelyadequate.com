...is surprisingly (to me, anyway) relatively few â€“ about one per 2.5 seconds. Something[^spikey] to keep in mind when speccing out systems.

[^spikey]: Of course, access patterns won't ever be distributed uniformly and different workloads are spikey to varying degrees.

*Relatedly:* There's a lot of hours in a year, especially for systems running 24/7. A cloud server[^m4large] that costs $0.12/hour seems pretty inexpensive, yet it'll rack up a $1000 bill at the end of the year.

[^m4large]: An example from the AWS universe: `m4.large` with 200 GB of EBS storage. (Disregarding savings plans or other cost-cutting measures for always-on instances.)

Doing the math isn't hard, of course, but your[^weird] brain might not always do it if left unprompted.

[^weird]: Again, *maybe I'm wired weird* and you're able to interpolate easily.
