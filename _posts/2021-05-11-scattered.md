The title will make a non-zero amount of sense soon, don't worry.

To illustrate the `README.md` of my [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/)-based [thesis typesetting tool](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-thesis), I was looking for a way of showcasing some example pages of [*my* Master's thesis](https://github.com/doersino/UnicodeMathML/blob/master/docs/doersing-unicodemath-to-mathml.pdf) â€“ the principal reason for the tool's existence â€“ in a visually appealing manner. The goal was to showcase the cover page, the table of contents, and similar "highlights" while visually communicating that yes, this tool was indeed suitable and battle-tested for large documents.

In my mind, a basic grid of thumbnails wouldn't cut it since most pages aren't very unique from a *layout* point of view. Neither would a few larger thumbnails of select pages as barely any of the pages are interesting from a *content* point of view. I settled on generating a "scatter plot" with most pages in the background, partially obscured, and some interesting ones out in front:

The rest of this article walks you through the workflow I came up with to generate this image.


## Converting a PDF to a series of images

Starting out with a PDF document `thesis.pdf`, the first step involved figuring out how to render its pages to more versatile (or at least malleable) image files. It turns out that the venerable [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) â€“ which I like to imagine as a rusty and disorganized but bottomless toolbox â€“ is up to the task.

I knew that it supports indexing to access specific pages of a PDF, so I wrote this Bash loop:

```bash
for i in {0..106}; do
    convert \
      "thesis.pdf"[$i] \
      -thumbnail x500 \
      "thesis-page-$i.png"
done
```

You can ignore any warnings related to color profiles â€“ they don't seem to affect the end result.

The `-thumbnail x500` bit resizes each page to a height of 500 pixels, which seemed sufficient for my purposes here. According to [the documentation](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php?#thumbnail), the `-thumbnail` flag has a speed advantage over the more commonly used `-resize` option.

Later, I [realized](https://aleksandarjakovljevic.com/convert-pdf-images-using-imagemagick/) that the loop wasn't actually necessary, although it helps with keeping track of the progress â€“ even with the `-verbose` flag, the following ImageMagick invocation takes a lot of silent thinking time (despite being faster in the end, and not requiring you to look up the page count):

```bash
convert "thesis.pdf" -thumbnail x500 "thesis-page-%03d.png"
```

Great! Thinking about how best to arrange the images, my mind quickly went to building a throw-away website â€“ using JavaScript-generated CSS transforms for the scattering effect seemed like a low-fuss way of getting the job done.

But first, I needed to generate a bunch of `<img>` tags referencing the pages/images.


## Generating an HTML file

To generate the `<img>` tags, I initially copied the output of `ls -1` (which forces a single column of filenames only, without any metadata) into Sublime Text and used its [multi-cursor capabilities](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/multiple_selection_with_the_keyboard.html) to wrap each filename in a tag. But you don't need any of that, good old' `sed` and a basic [regular expression](https://regexr.com) will do the trick:

```bash
ls -1 | grep "thesis-page-" | sed 's/^\(.*\)$/<img src="\1">/' > scattered.html
```

If you now open `scattered.html` in the browser of your choice, you'll be presented with a grid view of your pages â€“ if that's what you're after, you can stop here (although you might wish to visually set the individual pages apart using borders and margins).

This is actually a semi-useful [contact print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print) of your PDF.


## Scattering the pages with CSS and JavaScript

To transform `scatter.html` into something resembling the picture at the top of the article, a bit of general styling is required.

```html
<style>
    body {
        margin: 100px;
        background-color: #eee;
    }
    img {
        display: inline-block;
        position: absolute;
        background-color: white;
        box-shadow: 0 0 5px #0005;
    }
</style>
```

What's going on here?

* The `body`'s `margin` more than accounts for the additional space taken up by the pages once they're rotated slightly. Its light gray `background-color` induces a modicum of contrast against the white background of the pages.
* The `display` and `position` properties set for all `<img>` tags are required for the positioning and rotation work that's coming up after this list.
* Since PDF pages can have transparent backgrounds, a neutral `background-color` makes sure everything's opaque (notably, PDFs created using [Chrome's built-in print functionality]({{ "/posts/print.html" | relative_url }}) feature transparent margins).
* Finally, the `box-shadow: 0 0 5px #0005;` part gives the images/pages a bit of a drop shadow. Even if you're familiar with CSS colors, the notation `#0005` might strike you as slightly unusual â€“ it means `#000` (red, green, and blue each set to zero, *i.e.*, black) with `5` fifteenths (so, a third) of opacity. A semi-transparent gray, then.

This general styling must now be supplemented with more *specific* styling *for each image* where its position, rotation, and `z-index` is set. The integer-valued `z-index` property determines the drawing order â€“ elements with larger values will show up in front. We'll be setting it randomly to disable the browser's default behavior where elements defined later (*i.e.*, the last few pages) render in front.

All this is accomplished the easiest with a bit of JavaScript:

```html
<script>
    document.querySelectorAll("img").forEach(e => {
        const x = 1500 * Math.random();
        const y = 600 * Math.random();
        const angle = 20 * (Math.random() * 2 - 1);
        const z = parseInt(Math.random() * 100);

        const style = `
            transform: translate(${x}px, ${y}px)
                       rotate(${angle}deg);
            z-index: ${z};
        `;
        e.setAttribute("style", style);
    });
</script>
```

Nothing too fancy going on here â€“ for each image, a random position, angle, and `z-index` is generated and applied through a `style` attribute. (Depending on how many pages your PDF has, you might wish to adjust the constants.)

Assuming these two snippets are located in a file `prettify.html`, you can add them to `scattered.html` as follows:

```bash
cat "prettify.html" >> "scattered.html"
```

(The `>>` operator appends to the target instead of overwriting it.)

Open `scattered.html` in your browser again. Things should look a bit more exciting now! You might need to scale down the page (via <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>-</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>-</kbd> depending on your OS) to get everything visible at once, then keep refreshing until you get a pleasing arrangement.

{:.wide}
![]({{ "/static/scattered-basic.png" | relative_url }})

Once you're satisfied, take a screenshot and chop off your browser's window chrome in any image editor.

*But wait, there's more!*


## Prioritizing pages and visual tweaks

In my use case, there were a few pages â€“ the title page, the table of contents, the start of a chapter â€“ that needed to be shown at the top of the pile. On an infinite time scale, refreshing a bunch of times will eventually come up with a configuration matching these requirements. Since I didn't have infinite time available on this occasion, I implemented a way of prioritizing specific pages by adding a `z="1000"` (or any other number) attribute to the corresponding `<img>` tags.

(When editing `scattered.html` to add these `z` attributes, note that any number larger than 100 will push the page to the top since the JavaScript snippet generates values between 0 and 100 for all pages without an explicit `z` attribute.)

At the same time, I thought that fading pages towards gray the further in the back they are located might add some visual interest. To this end, I came up with the absolutely-not-based-on-any-solid-theory formula

$$ðŸ’¡ = 100 - \sqrt{100 - \min(100, z)}.$$

To incorporate these changes, replace the JavaScript snippet above with this upgraded variant:

```html
<script>
    document.querySelectorAll("img").forEach(e => {
        const x = 1500 * Math.random();
        const y = 600 * Math.random();
        const angle = 20 * (Math.random() * 2 - 1);

        let z = parseInt(Math.random() * 100);
        if (e.getAttribute("z")) {
            z = parseInt(e.getAttribute("z"));
        }

        const brightness = 100 - Math.sqrt(100 - Math.min(100, z));

        const style = `
            transform: translate(${x}px, ${y}px)
                       rotate(${angle}deg);
            z-index: ${z};
            filter: brightness(${brightness}%)
        `;
        e.setAttribute("style", style);
    });
</script>
```

Finally, a light gray background didn't seem like the most interesting thing to be looking at, so I experimented with `linear-gradient`s to draw a pattern that's akin to a [cutting mat](https://www.google.com/search?q=cutting+mat&source=lnms&tbm=isch). Despite ending up sticking with gray for my `README.md` illustration purposes, I felt like sharing the fancier variant. As with the previous snippets, you can just append this one to `scattered.html`:

```html
<div class="bg"></div>
<style>
    .bg {
        position: absolute;
        width: 2500px;
        height: 2000px;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        z-index: -1;
        background:
            linear-gradient(0deg, #fff9 2px, #0000 2px),
            linear-gradient(90deg, #fff9 2px, #0000 2px),
            linear-gradient(0deg, #fff3 1px, #0000 1px),
            linear-gradient(90deg, #fff3 1px, #0000 1px),
            #364;
        background-size:
            100px 100px,
            100px 100px,
            20px 20px,
            20px 20px;
        background-position:
            -2px -2px;
    }
</style>
```

Upon refreshing `scattered.html` in your browser, you should now see something along the lines of the image shown in the introduction. As before, keep refreshing until the gods of [RNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) bless you with a nice-looking arrangement.
