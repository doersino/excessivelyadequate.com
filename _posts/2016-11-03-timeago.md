Static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) produce significantly snappier sites than your run-of-the-mill content management system -- but at a cost: By definition, there cannot be any server-side dynamic content. That means: no comments, no suggestions based on browsing activity, and (more trivially) no way of displaying how long ago a post was published.

When I first started this blog, I happily used [jekyll-timeago](https://github.com/markets/jekyll-timeago) until I realized -- embarrassingly late -- that the "posted N days ago" line below every post won't update until the page is regenerated, which happens pretty much only whenever I publish a new post because of the way I [deploy]({{ "/posts/deploy.html" | relative_url }}) my blog.


## JavaScript to the rescue ðŸš€

If the problem can't be solved on the server, let's make the client do the work instead! In this post, I'll show you how.

Somewhere in your theme's `_layouts/post.html` (or similar), you probably have some code that outputs the date on which a given post was published[^1]:

{% raw  %}
```html
<time datetime="{{ page.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">
    posted on {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}
</time>
```
{% endraw %}

Replace it with the following snippet:

{% raw  %}
```html
<time id="postedon" datetime="{{ page.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">
    posted <span id="postedago"></span>
    on {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}
</time>
```
{% endraw %}

The `id` attributes allows for convenient access to the `<time>` and `<span>` elements by means of the JavaScript function `getElementById()`. In addition, the inserted `<span>` serves as a placeholder for the "N days ago" text we'll add using JavaScript[^2].

Now, with the markup in place, we'll need to actually make it work. Add the following piece of JavaScript code[^3] to your `_layouts/post.html` file, either inside a `<script>` element or in an external file included via `<script src="...">`. Note that you need to paste it **after** the above code:

```javascript
function ago(date) {
    function render(n, unit) {
        return n + " " + unit + ((n == 1) ? "" : "s") + " ago";
    }

    var seconds = Math.floor((new Date() - date) / 1000);

    var interval = Math.floor(seconds / (60 * 60 * 24 * 30 * 365));
    if (Math.floor(seconds / (60 * 60 * 24 * 30 * 365)) >= 1) {
        return render(interval, "year");
    }
    interval = Math.floor(seconds / (60 * 60 * 24 * 30));
    if (interval >= 1) {
        return render(interval, "month");
    }
    interval = Math.floor(seconds / (60 * 60 * 24));
    if (interval >= 1) {
        return render(interval, "day");
    }
    interval = Math.floor(seconds / (60 * 60));
    if (interval >= 1) {
        return render(interval, "hour");
    }
    interval = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
    if (interval >= 1) {
        return render(interval, "minute");
    }
    interval = Math.floor(seconds);
    return render(interval, "second");
}

var date = Date.parse(document.getElementById("postedon").getAttribute("datetime"));
document.getElementById("postedago").innerHTML = ago(date);
```

I'm sure the function could be refactored to be more elegant, but it's reasonably self-explanatory and works fine the way it is.


## Summary

After incorporating and deploying the changes outlined above, the posts on your Jekyll site will be annotated with a human-readable representation how long ago they were published. This is an example of [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement): users who choose to disable JavaScript will still see the absolute date.




[^1]: For example, my theme has something along those lines in the meta section at the end of each post.
[^2]: If the user's browser doesn't speak JavaScript (or, more commonly, if the user chooses to disable it), the `<span>` won't show up and they won't know that anything's missing. The cool kids call this kind of approach [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement).
