Because I'm approximately 270 years old and listen to music (MP3 files, no less!) on my *computer* instead of a smart speaker, sometimes I find myself wanting to adjust my Mac's system volume without needing to, say, get up from the couch. I'm sure there's plenty of iOS apps that can do that with varying amounts of tracking and in-app-purchases, but because, once again, I'm practically 270 years old, I prefer to SSH into my computer and run a command.

Thanks to [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript), the amount of trickery required to make this possible is kept to a minimum: Keeping in mind that the built-in `osascript` utility executes AppleScript code, running...

```bash
osascript -e "set volume output volume 100"
```

...will turn the volume up to its maximum – the number is interpreted as a percentage. You can also make things louder or quieter by some percentage points...

```bash
osascript -e "set volume output volume (output volume of (get volume settings) - 42)"
```

...or (un)mute the computer:

```bash
osascript -e "set volume with output muted"
osascript -e "set volume without output muted"
```

But, as you can see, these commands are a bit unintuitive and *a lot* unwieldy. To provide a better user experience in the "lazy couch potato" use case, I've written a few lines of bash that provide fewer-keystrokes access to these volume controls:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

USAGE="usage: vol [-h | --help | NUMBER_FROM_0_TO_100 | -DECREMENT | +INCREMENT]"

# if the argument isn't one of the expected values, display usage instructions
if [ "$1" == "-h" ] || [ "$1" == "--help" ] || ! [[ "$1" =~ ^$|^[+-]?[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "$USAGE"
    exit 1
fi

# retrieve old volume
OLD_VOLUME="$(osascript -e "output volume of (get volume settings)")"

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "$OLD_VOLUME"
else
    # default case: just set volume to specified value
    NEW_VOLUME="$1"

    # alternatively: decrement or increment?
    if [[ "$1" == -* ]] || [[ "$1" == +* ]]; then
        NEW_VOLUME=$(($OLD_VOLUME + $1))
    fi

    # clamp to [0, 100]
    if [ "$NEW_VOLUME" -lt 0 ] ; then
        NEW_VOLUME=0
    fi
    if [ "$NEW_VOLUME" -gt 100 ] ; then
        NEW_VOLUME=100
    fi

    # give feedback
    MUTED=""
    if [ "$NEW_VOLUME" -eq 0 ]; then
        MUTED="(muted)"
    fi
    echo "$OLD_VOLUME -> $NEW_VOLUME $MUTED"

    # set
    osascript -e "set volume output volume $NEW_VOLUME"
fi
```

You can also [find this script on GitHub](https://github.com/doersino/vol).

Paste these lines of code into a file named `vol`, place it in a directory that's on your `$PATH` and make sure the file's executable: run `chmod u+x vol`, for instance.

(A common choice of directory is `~/local/bin` – which you can put on your `$PATH` by adding `export PATH="$HOME/local/bin:$PATH` to your [`.bashrc` and/or `.bash_profile`](https://linuxize.com/post/bashrc-vs-bash-profile/) – but I tend to instead maintain small utilities like this as functions [in my `.bashrc`](https://github.com/doersino/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc). To each their own.)

Here's how to use the thusly-created `vol` command:

```text
$ vol --help
usage: vol [-h | --help | NUMBER_FROM_0_TO_100 | -DECREMENT | +INCREMENT]
```

```text
$ vol
26
```

```text
$ vol 0
26 -> 0 (muted)
```

```text
$ vol 30
0 -> 30
```

```text
$ vol +15
30 -> 45
```

```text
$ vol -3
45 -> 42
```
