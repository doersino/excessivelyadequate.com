In the context of [remotely adjusting a Mac's system volume]({% post_url 2022-02-10-vol %}), I've previously outed myself as an approximately-270-year-old who listens to music (MP3 files, no less!) on his *computer* instead of, say, a smart speaker.

Having recently taken delivery of a new[^new] computer, the question of how to move my library without losing playlists and (questionably) valuable metadata such as play counts presented itself. As luck would have it, [Swinsian](https://swinsian.com), the native, fast, minimalist, but fully-featured music player I've been using for the last couple of years[^before] stores all of its data in a basic SQLite database.

[^new]: A brand-new, M2-powered MacBook Air, if I may brag – it replaces a seven-year-old MacBook Pro, or, more accurately, the former leaves the latter in the dust like you wouldn't believe while, despite lacking a fan, barely getting warm at all.

[^before]: I switched to it from iTunes right around the time when it was rebranded as Music, aided by Swinsian's library import feature.

You should be able to find it within `~/Library/Application Support/Swinsian/`, right next to a backup of your license key:

If the directory structure of your music library won't change during your move, all you need to do is grab the whole directory (including `ArtCache/` – that'll save you some time rebuilding said cache) and move it to the same location on your new computer before launching Swinsian there for the first time.

If, like me, you're taking the move as an opportunity[^nifty] to store your files in a different location, this won't suffice; you'll need to adjust the path of each track in the database:

[^nifty]: I'd been storing my music library on a microSD card permanently inserted into the MacBook's SD card slot (the new Air doesn't have one) via a [Nifty MiniDrive](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1342319572/the-nifty-minidrive) adapter.

1. Make a copy of the database.

    ```sh
    cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Swinsian/Library.sqlite ~/Desktop/
    ```

2. Then open a SQLite session (`brew install sqlite` if it's not already installed on your system) on your copy of the database:

    ```
    $ sqlite3 ~/Desktop/Library.sqlite
    ```

3. Run the following self-explanatory SQL command, substituting the `/PREFIX/OF/YOUR/OLD/PATH/` and `/PREFIX/OF/YOUR/NEW/PATH/` with your paths.

    ```sql
    sqlite> UPDATE track SET path = replace(path, '/PREFIX/OF/YOUR/OLD/PATH/', '/PREFIX/OF/YOUR/NEW/PATH/');
    ```

    If you're curious about the database's structure and want to explore a bit, run `.tables` to list the available tables or `.schema TABLE` to view a given `TABLE`'s columns – or use a GUI tool like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com).

That's it – after quitting SQLite using <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>, move the newly-modified `~/Desktop/Library.sqlite` to `~/Library/Application Support/Swinsian/` on your new machine (and don't forget to migrate the `ArtCache/` and license).

Swinsian's stats display (Window > Show Library Statistics) should now look identical on your old and new computers. Here's mine (the first track having been added in 2018 is the result of an iTunes reorganization – play counts were preserved even then; they date back to early 2015):
