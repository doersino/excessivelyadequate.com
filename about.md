TODO update this

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog was most recently updated on {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}. It is hosted on [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) and its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/doersino/excessivelyadequate.com/). Headlines are set in [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat), code is displayed in [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and everything else uses the [Asap](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/asap) font -- except for math, which is displayed using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) and configured to use the [TeX Gyre Pagella](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/pagella) font. [Bigfoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com) helps make footnotes easy to use.
