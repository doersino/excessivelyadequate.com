I'll keep things short – this page serves three purposes:

1. Redirecting you to **my main website, [noahdoersing.com](https://noahdoersing.com)**, in case you want to yell at me *(if I'm slightly wrong about something)* or offer me a job *(if I'm 100% right about everything, so that's not going to happen)*.
2. Satisfying any lawyers that might be lurking in the depths of whatever lawyers lurk in. If you're one of them, here's a [link to my Datenschutzerklärung](https://noahdoersing.com/datenschutz.html). *(Summary for non-lawyers: No cookies, no analytics, no server logs, no external resources, and – as far as I can tell – no other ways for you to surrender any of your personal information.)*
3. And this:


## Colophon

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog was most recently updated on {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}. It is hosted on [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) and its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/doersino/excessivelyadequate.com), where you can also find the [license](https://github.com/doersino/excessivelyadequate.com#license).

Headlines and such are set in [Work Sans](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans), code is displayed in [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases) and everything else uses the [Literata](https://github.com/googlefonts/literata) font – except for math, which is displayed using [KaTeX](https://katex.org) with its default font.
